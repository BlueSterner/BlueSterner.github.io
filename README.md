## This site is incomplete!!


```
I am working on this as a **personal project** to teach myself web development. There is currently no backend, and as such it doesn't serve much of a purpose currently.
I hope to expand this site as I get better though. The point of this site is to give it to my friends to organize social events and see who likes what activities.
I don't use any of their real names on this site. The question does remain, "why don't you just use a google form?" Well, that doesn't teach me anything!
```

By the time this is over I should have:

- [x] Basic skeltal frame of what I want to do with this site
- [ ] Beautiful Visuals and an aestetically pleasing website. ðŸŒ¸
- [ ] A fully functioning site with responsive design with Javascript code.
- [ ] A way to take friends inputs and turn them into automatically generated graphs that update upon new or changed responses. :bar_chart:
- [ ] A way to sign up, do a captcha as a user signs up to avoid bot flooding, and a way for me to email verify users and approve their accounts. ðŸ“©

## This site is incomplete

I am working on this as a **personal project** to teach myself web development. There is currently no backend, and as such it doesn't serve much of a purpose currently. I hope to expand this site as I get better though. The point of this site is to give it to my friends to organize social events and see who likes what activities. I don't use any of their real names on this site. The question does remain, "why don't you just use a google form?" Well, that doesn't teach me anything!

By the time this is over I should have:

- [x] #739
- [ ] https://github.com/octo-org/octo-repo/issues/740
- [ ] Add delight to the experience when all tasks are complete :tada:
1. A fully functioning site with responsive design with Javascript code.
2. Beautiful Visuals and an aestetically pleasing website.
3. A way to take friends inputs and turn them into automatically generated graphs that update upon new responses or changed to responses.
4. A way to sign up, do a captcha as a user signs up to avoid bot flooding, and a way for me to email verify users and approve their accounts.

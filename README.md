## This site is incomplete

I am working on this as a **personal project** to teach myself web development. There is currently no backend, and as such it doesn't serve much of a purpose currently. I hope to expand this site as I get better though. The point of this site is to give it to my friends to organize social events and see who likes what activities. I don't use any of their real names on this site. The question does remain, "why don't you just use a google form?" Well, that doesn't teach me anything!

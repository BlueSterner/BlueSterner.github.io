<h3>This is my website form to collect data on the types of events you guys like.</h3>

<p><br><br>Here is the link to the form on activities that you all like: <a href="activities.html">CLICK HERE</a><br>Though please login first so I can create 
    publically available graphs on what you guys select. The login page is <a href="signup.html">here.</a></p>

<p>The question may occur to you, "why did you create this rather than simply make a google form?" Well... That's not a coding project!
    <br> I did this to give myself front-end developing experience and also this site, as I develop it, should have more functionality than a simple google form.
